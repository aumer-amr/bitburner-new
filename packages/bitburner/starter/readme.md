These are files i used to gain some traction in the early game, they are far from optimized they more or less brute force the early game.
It auto hacks, you just need to manually backdoor them. I just run these a few days overnight, and are able to buy most augments and start working on the early game.

I highly recommend not using them if you're starting out for the first time, and instead try to understand the game mechanics and gain some coding knowledge.
